But even now, when things are back to normal, times are even harder. Cost of just existing is too high.. Than there is food, gas, every material, electronic, you name it.. Prices are spiking like crazy and no one knows when they will stop growing.\nWar is not over, and who knows how close Putin is to sending those big pointy missiles all world.Crime and murder rates have skyrocketed since last year\n.Oh, and monkeypox virus is a thing.\nSo, we are happy to inform you we have found the solution, and since you\'re reading this, you\'re almost on your way to eternal cycle of happiness! You see, when you pay for your and your friends drink in cafe that is showed in our app, scan the qr code on the receipt with built in qr scanner, and you will get the very valuable points.

Than you spend those points in all sorts of cafes who have all sorts of offers with all sorts of discounts that save you money. You can get extra points by completing challenge tasks on home page.\nSooo.. get up, socialize, have a drink to earn points, earn points to save money, save money to be able to socialize more!\n\nMade by Algebra students Sandro(Å andor), Stjepan(Stipe), Fran(Franz), Matija(Matija) in the summer of 2022.\n\n\"</string>
